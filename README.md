# Flutter-Firebase-Authentication (Google signIn / email and password both)

This is the authorization part of a social Flutter App that I'm creating that will invove multiple fun features .
I am making this Github repo to demo how you can use Firebase as backend with your flutter app for signing up/in users (also sign in by Google ) .

The design is from : [Login Catalog](https://github.com/david-legend/login_catalog)
